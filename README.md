first encoder me enter a plaintext and encrypt then youll get a result 
copy that result and paste it in vigenere ciphertext and dcrypt

# playfair cipher ass2


# shift cipher ass1
check part 1 if you get the same ciphertext attack at dawn will be the ans with key=7

but if you get some other then

copy the ciphertext you got in part 1 to part 3's ciphertext and put key = 3 so move 3 alphabets ahead
and get the plain text acc if the ciphertext is wkh then the plaintext would be the 
paste the same plaintext in part 4 and get the answer

ans for above

and if you get this

ans is this

paste part 2 ka key in part 4 ka key , then plaintext ka first line in part 4 plaintext then encrypt then whatever ciphertext you get paste it below
llly now same key and plaintext ka second line in part 4 ka plaintext encrypt whatever ciphertext you get copy it in part 5 next to the previous ciphertext do this for all the lines youll be pasting 5 ciphertext in the final box after encrypting line by line 

# cipher block chaining 
1)Generate the plaintext, the key and the IV
2)Select the IV and paste it in part 5 and also in part 3 ka first box
3)Copy the first line from the plaintext and paste it in part 3 ka second box  and then calculate xor 
4)Copy this xor and paste it in part 4 ka plaintext 
5)Copy part 2 ka key and paste it in part 4 ka key then encrypt
6)Now copy the ciphertext and paste it in part 5 next to the IV that we had already pasted 
7)Now copy the cipertext in part 4 and paste it in part 3 ka first box
8)Now copy the second line from the plaintext in part 2 and paste it in part 3 ka second box and then calculate xor 
9)Now paste this xor in part 4 ka plaintext and encrypt. (key wont change ie keep the same key)
10)Now copy the ciphertext generated in part 4 and append it in part 5 
11)Again copy the ciphertext from part 4 and paste it in part 3 ka first box 
12)Now copy the third line from the plaintext in part 2 and paste it in the second box of part 2 and calculate xor
13)Now copy the xor and paste in part 4 ka plaintext and encrypt 
14)Now copy the ciphertext generated in part 4 and append it in part 5
15)Now again copy the ciphertext and paste it in part 3 ka first box
16)Now copy the 4th line from the plaintext in part 2 and paste it in part 3 ka second box and calculate xor 
17)Now copy the xor and paste it in part 4 ka plaintext and encrypt
18)Now copy the ciphertext generated and append it in part 5 
19)Again copy the ciphertxt and paste it in part 3 ka first box 
20)Copy the last line from the plaintext in part 2 and paste it in part 3 ka second box and calculate xor 
21)Copy the xor and paste it in part 4 ka plaintext and encrypt 
22)Now copy the ciphertext from part 4 and append it in part 5

first complete  part 4 then encypt then paste this ciphertext in part 3 ka first box , paste the same plaintext used in part 4 in part 3 ka second box then calculate xor . then paste this xor in the final part 5 ka ans. keep repeating this method for all 5 lines of plaintext and paste the xors in part 5 5 times 

# public key cryptosystem
Enter a plaintext then scroll down choose 1024 bits or something then press on encrypt. youll get the ciphertext now decrypt it done

# digital signature scheme 
first press oh SHA1 youll get the hash output then scroll down and click on the 1024 bit or whatever. now copy the hash output and paste it input to RSA. apply RSA done
